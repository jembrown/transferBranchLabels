# transferBranchLabels
Program to take branch labels (e.g., support values) from an arbitrary number of labeled trees (e.g., majority-rule consensus from bootstrapped trees or a posterior distribution) and place any  relevant labels on another (e.g., ML) tree.  Topologies need not be identical or nested.
